1. Changes in the Makefile
a) set the CHARMHOME variable to the path of charm directory

Compiling the code:
1. make
2. for debugging: make OPTS=-g -O0

Running the code:
./charmrun +p8 ++local ./advection arg1 arg2 arg3
where arg1 = max_depth of the mesh
      arg2 = #zones in one dimension per chare
      arg3 = #iterations for which the code is to be run
      arg4 = load balancing frequency (should be a multiple of 3, 3 is the refinement frequency)
      arg5(optional) = intial mesh size (set to 128 by default)


Running the code with CkLoop or CkLoopHybrid for getGranularityDecision:
1. Compile by passing OPTS="-DUSE_CKLOOP" to make
   Example: make OPTS="-DUSE_CKLOOP"

2. If running using CkLoopHybrid, then rebuild Charm++ after replacing charm/src/ck-ldb/GreedyLB.C
   with ckloop_schedule/GreedyLB.C. While running the program use +GreedyLB for load balancer.

3. Run the program with 7 arguments
   ./charmrun +p8 ++local ./advection arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5 staticFraction chunkSize
   NOTE: arg5 i.e. mesh size is not optional. The staticFraction and chunkSize are optional.



READING ORDER
1. advection.ci - read the entry methods - iterate, remeshing, doComputationStep
2. QuadIndex.h - contains the bit Vector based 3D Octtree implementaion
                provides interface to get neighbor indices, child indices, etc.
3. Advection.C - contains implementation of boundary exchange functions, iterpolation, 
                finite state machine for granularity decision consensus, refinement and
                coarsening functions, etc.
